Description: A tool for survival analysis using a discrete time approach with ensemble binary classification. 'spect' provides a
	simple interface consistent with commonly used R data analysis packages, such as 'caret', a variety of parameter options
	to help facilitate search automation, a high degree of transparency to the end-user - all intermediate data sets and
	parameters are made available for further analysis and useful, out-of-the-box visualizations of model performance. Methods
	for transforming survival data into discrete-time are adapted from the 'autosurv' package by Suresh et al., (2022)
